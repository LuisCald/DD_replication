# TODO: Norm Explanation
# Normalization is a good technique to use when you do not know the distribution of your 
# data or when you know the distribution is not Gaussian (a bell curve). 
# Normalization is useful when your data has varying scales and the algorithm 
# you are using does not make assumptions about the distribution of your data, 
# such as k-nearest neighbors and artificial neural networks. Since PCA is non-parametric, this is ok!

# Standardization assumes that your data has a Gaussian (bell curve) distribution. 
# This does not strictly have to be true, but the technique is more effective if 
# your attribute distribution is Gaussian. Standardization is useful when your data 
# has varying scales and the algorithm you are using does make assumptions about your 
# data having a Gaussian distribution, such as linear regression, logistic regression,
# and linear discriminant analysis.



# The theory behinds Markov Chain Monte Carlo (the family of algorithms that includes the Metropolis
#  algorithm as a special case) guarantees that (under certain conditions) Metropolis will give you the right answer. 
#  The acceptance rate is related only to the number of steps you will need to find the correct answer
# (with a certain level of precision). If the acceptance rate is too low or too high it will take longer 
# time, but eventually you will get the correct answer. The intuition is as follows; you will get high 
# acceptance when you make small movements not too far away of your current position, but if you move 
# slowly it will take a lot of time to sample all the distribution. On the contrary, if you try to 
# make larger movements chances are high you propose movements to regions of low probability and 
# then you will get a lot of rejections. So in practice even when you will "eventually" get the 
# right answer is a good idea to tune the acceptance rate to provide better performance in this 
# paper by Gelman they provide evidence that a acceptance rate of ~0.23 is optimal. PyMC3 has an 
# option to tune a Metropolis algorithm based on monitoring the acceptance rate.
